# DCS-Fonts
Fonts and font artefacts for DCS (Digital Combat Simulator).  Orginal Adobe Illustrator and subsequent characters in SVG format ready to go into your favourite font creator.

All of the characters and symbols are created as different layers in the single Illustrator file, and then they are isolated (the unwanted layers need to be deleted and an SVG is created for each character.  These single character SVG files are in this repository as well.
